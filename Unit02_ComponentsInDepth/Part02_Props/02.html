      I still don't get it, here's the link
       https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#One-Way-Data-Flow
          
      About <One-way Data Flow>
      -> When the parent prop updates, it'll flow down to the child
      -> If you MUTATE a prop inside a child comp, you'll be WARNED (in the console)

      These are the possible cases you might mutate them
      1. The prop is used to { PASS an INITIAL val } (child use it as local var)
      2. The prop is as a raw val that { NEEDS to be TRANSFORMED }
    
      Oh, one more thing!
      || Since the object & arrays is JavaScript are passed by REF
      || so you might accidently AFFECT the prop's val to parent's side
     */ 
    Vue.component('exp03-oneway-binding', {
      props: [
        'initialCounter',
        'size',
      ],

      // #1 the prop .. (the `this` might mean inside the 'comp definition'?)
      data: function () {
        return {
          counter: this.initialCounter
        };
      },

      // #2 the prop is passed in that needs to be transformed?
      computed: {
        normalizedSize: function () {
          return this.size.trim().toLowercase()
        },
      },
    });
